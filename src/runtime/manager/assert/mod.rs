//! assertion implementation
//! Motivation:
//! - provide assert for developer testing the meerkat source code
//! 
//! Design:
//! - each assertion spawns a def actor, subscribing to all free reactive names in the assertion
//! - once all transactions required by the assertion are committed and applied by the actor
//!   we decide if the assertions succeeds or not
//! - (todo) if some required transactions never arrives, assertion timeout
//! 
//! We treat each assertion as a weaker form of transaction + 2 phase process
//! - no explicit transaction id
//! - since assertion is read only, (Phase 1)
//!   trans_read requests are sended to relevant var actors
//!   who send back pred txn immediately (no acquisition for read lock)
//! - (Phase 2) send UsrReadDefRequest to assertion def actor
//!   when hearing back from the def actor, send back AssertComplete
//!
